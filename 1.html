  <p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS" target="_blank" title="BTS wikipedia">BTS (Korean: <u>방탄소년단</u>; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan)</strong></a>, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment.[3]
  The septet—composed of RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output.
  Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres.</p>

  Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.
  The group has released several albums and performed on several world tours.</p>
